With orderByRaw it is possible to execute multiple sql statements. The statement 
below orders contact by first_name, then delete all data from table contacts

SQL select * from `contacts` order by first_name;drop table contacts;-- ASC

Another example of corrupting data:

SQL select * from `contacts` order by first_name;UPDATE contacts SET email="ha@ha.com";-- ASC
