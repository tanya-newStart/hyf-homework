Salmon roasted in butter
INGREDIENTS
Yield: 4 to 6 servings
4 tablespoons (½ stick) butter
4 tablespoons minced chervil,
parsley or dill
1 salmon fillet, 1½ to 2 pounds
Salt and freshly ground black
pepper to taste
Lemon wedges
PREPARATION
Step 1
Preheat the oven to 475 degrees. Place the butter and half the
herb in a roasting pan just large enough to fit the salmon and
place it in the oven. Heat about 5 minutes, until the butter melts
and the herb begins to sizzle.
Step 2
Add the salmon to the pan, skin side up. Roast 4 minutes. Remove
from the oven, then peel the skin off. (If the skin does not lift right
off, cook 2 minutes longer.) Sprinkle with salt and pepper and turn
the fillet over. Sprinkle with salt and pepper again.
Step 3
Roast 3 to 5 minutes more, depending on the thickness of the fillet
and the degree of doneness you prefer. Cut into serving portions,
spoon a little of the butter over each and garnish with the
remaining herb. Serve with lemon wedges.
