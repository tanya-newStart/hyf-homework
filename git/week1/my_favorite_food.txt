Ingredients:
2.5 lbs. russet potatoes 
1 yellow onion 
2 large eggs 
2-3 Tbsp all-purpose flour 
1 tsp salt 
1/4 tsp black pepper 
3-4 Tbsp cooking oil (for frying) 
Instructions
Peel the potatoes and onion, then rinse with cold water.
In a large bowl, grate potatoes and onion on the star-shaped side of a grater, taking turns and mixing the grated mixture. This will prevent potatoes from browning.
Add eggs, flour, salt, and pepper and mix well. The batter will be on a liquid side. Alternatively, you can prepare it in a food processor by grinding all ingredients together until no large chunks are left, for about 3-4 minutes.
Preheat a large non-stick skillet on medium-high heat and add 1 tbsp of oil. Add a large spoonful of pancake batter and fry until golden brown, flip and cook on the other side. Repeat with the remaining batter.
Serve the deruny hot with a dollop of sour cream. Makes about 30 deruny.
